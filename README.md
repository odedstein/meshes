# odedstein/meshes

This repository contains a variety of meshes and associated data that are useful for examples in computer graphics.

My goal with this repository is to provide meshes with only minimal licensing (such as attribution or attribution/nonprofit).
Every object comes with an attribution, as well as a mention of the license under which it was originally released.
They can be found in the object-info.md file in the folder of each object.

_Please make sure you follow the requirements of the respective licenses for each object in this collection._
