This repository contains a variety of meshes and associated data that are useful for examples in computer graphics.

It is the goal to provide meshes with only minimal licensing (such as attribution or attribution/nonprofit).
Every object comes with an attribution, as well as a mention of the license under which it was originally released.

_Please make sure you follow the requirements of the respective licenses for each object in this collection._
